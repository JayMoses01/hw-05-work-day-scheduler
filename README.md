# hw-05-work-day-scheduler by Jay Moses


# Description

I created a work day scheduler with this functionality:
* The current day is automatically displayed at the top of the calendar.
* Time blocks are shown for standard business hours.
* Each time block is color coded based on whether it occurs in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
* The user can click into a time block, enter text, and then click the corresponding blue button on the right to save the contents to local storage.
* When refreshing the page, the saved time block text contents persist.
